0,"41 fours, 21 sixes and a whopping 481. Let that sink in, blimey! Australia would wish they were a goldfish so that they can shrug off this day. On the other hand, a remarkable record-breaking day at the office for England. The end result is they are 3-0 up in the series and head to Chester-le-Street next to try and extend the lead. On that note, this is a gobsmacked and dizzy Sriram AS taking leave along with Akshay Maanay, Rishi Roy and Shashikant Singh. See ya!"
1,"Alex Hales, Man of the Match: It's as good as it gets (To score a hundred at his home ground). Managed to replicate my performance against Pakistan a couple of years back, it's a special day. To beat the opposition by close to 240 runs is unbelievable. I think the pool of talent we have got around in England in white-ball cricket is really good at the moment. Striving to improve more."
2,"Eoin Morgan, England captain: Certainly, it's a proud feeling. To operate at that level throughout the whole game was outstanding. We have two more games left and two more opportunities to score big for the batsmen. It's a good headache to have (about the selection). The talent we have in the change room is brilliant. We are going to Durham next, will try to reassess. We have a pretty settled batting unit. We need to be top of our game, 50-over game has moved forward dramatically over the last few years and we have put ourselves in a position where we have adapted brilliantly."
3,"Tim Paine, Australian captain: Today was a learning experience for all of us. As I said, It was tough, no matter where we put the fielders, they hit the gaps and they were red-hot, that's the yardstick of 50-over cricket. Some young guys are getting some games. 12 months is a long time in cricket (looking ahead of World Cup) and things can change pretty quickly."

7,"20:53 Local Time: A jubilant England bunch shake hands with beaming smiles on their faces. Hi-fives follow and they take a 3-0 lead in the five-match series. In all fairness, nothing out of the ordinary and unexpected transpired in the denouement. A record-breaking score of 481 carnage set England up and their bowlers didn't have to do anything out of the box, really. It was imperative for the visitors' batsmen to go after the bowling from ball one and they did show some intent. Head, Marsh and Stoinis got starts instinctively but an intimidating target must've sent chills down the spine for their batters. The required rate kept creeping up with each passing over and they were forced to play catch-up cricket as England's spin duo - Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali shared 7 spoils between them to shoot the Aussies for 239. David Willey chipped in with 2 wickets as well. Presentations imminent, do stick around."
8,"Adil Rashid to Stanlake, out Stumped!! And Rashid hits the final nail in the coffin for England as they beat Australia by 242 runs - their largest margin of victory in ODIs. No point for Stanlake hanging in there. Rashid slips in a googly that turns away from the batsman. Stanlake is hoodwinked by the turn as he drags his back leg in the process, losing his balance and Buttler takes care of the rest. Stanlake st Buttler b Adil Rashid 1(4)"
